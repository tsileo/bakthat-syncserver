# Bakthat SyncSever

Draft of a synchronization server for [bakthat](http://docs.bakthat.io).

Requirements:

- MongoDB
- Flask

Be careful, you should use ssl (even with a self signed cert) and run it whith something like gunicorn.

## Setting up

### Server side

You should run it with a proxy like gunicorn of your favorite tool.

    $ python server.py
     * Running on http://0.0.0.0:2405/
     * Restarting with reloader

## Client side

Assuming bakthat is already installed.

Change LOGIN and PASSWORD on top of server.py, you can also change the port a the end (2405 by default).

Edit ~/.bakthat.yml for each client.

    sync:
      auto: false
      url: http://yourserver:2405
      username: login
      password: password

Now you can run on each client.

    $ bakthat sync

That's it.
